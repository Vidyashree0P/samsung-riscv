Introduction to Instruction of RISC-V64

In the realm of computer architecture, RISC-V stands out as a highly flexible and streamlined instruction set architecture (ISA). Within the RISC-V RV64G (64-bit) architecture, various instruction types have been ingeniously designed to optimize different computational tasks. These instruction types—including R-Type, I-Type, S-Type, B-Type, U-Type, and J-Type—each serve unique functions, from arithmetic and logical operations to memory storage and conditional branching. Understanding these instructions provides a key to unleashing the full potential of RISC-V’s modular and efficient architecture.
Types of RISC-V Instructions

1. R-Type Instructions: These are Register-Register operations. They perform arithmetic and logical operations.

2. I-Type Instructions: Used for Immediate values typically in data transfer and arithmetic

3. S-Type Instructions: Store operations that utilize both a base register and an immediate offset.

4. U-Type Instructions: Used for Upper immediate instructions, which load large constants.

5. B-Type Instructions: Branch operations that allow conditional jumps.

6. J-Type Instructions: Jump instructions for long-range jumps.
